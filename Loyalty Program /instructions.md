## **Bounty: Blockchain-Based Loyalty Program**

Build a simple, effective loyalty program that leverages the Metis L2 blockchain.

### **Description:**  
This bounty invites participants to create a loyalty program on the Metis L2 blockchain. The program can allow businesses to issue loyalty points to customers, track their transactions securely, and provide a platform for redeeming points. 
This solution will help participants gain hands-on experience building on Metis Layer 2, demonstrating its practical use and efficiency, as well as low transaction fees.


### **Development Details:**  
Participants will design, develop, and launch a basic version of the loyalty program. This includes:

1. **Smart Contracts:** Develop one smart contract using Solidity:

   - **Loyalty Contract:** Handles issuing, transferring, and redeeming loyalty points:
     - **IssuePoints():** Allows businesses to create and issue points to customers.
     - **TransferPoints():** Facilitates transferring points between customers.
     - **RedeemPoints():** Enables customers to exchange points for rewards or services.

The contract should include mechanisms to securely manage these functions and storing balances and transactions on the blockchain.

2. **Frontend:** Build a simple web interface allowing users to interact with the program:
   - **Businesses:** Log in, issue points, and view customer activity.
   - **Customers:** View their points balance, transfer points, and redeem them for rewards.

3. **Integration:** Use a library like Web3.js to connect the frontend, or alternatively use a framework like Scaffold ETH to facilitate the use of templates with integration tools.

### **Judging Criteria:**  
1. **Simplicity:** The solution should be straightforward to use and easy for businesses and customers to understand.
2. **Functionality:** The loyalty program must issue, track, and redeem points effectively.
3. **Usability:** The web interface should be user-friendly, with a clear journey for both businesses and customers.

### **Tech Stack (not mandatory, only recommended):**  

1. **Solidity:** For writing and deploying smart contracts. 
2. **JavaScript/HTML/CSS/NextJS:** For building the web interface and frontend solution.
3. **Scaffold ETH:** An open-source framework designed to accelerate Ethereum and EVM-compatible dApp development. It provides starter templates, smart contract examples, and frontend integration tools, making it easier to build and deploy blockchain-based applications.

Metis is a Layer 2 blockchain solution that is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This means participants can write smart contracts in Solidity, an Ethereum-compatible language, and deploy them directly onto the Metis blockchain.
Participants will gain practical experience building a real-world application, demonstrating Metis L2 blockchain capabilities, and learning through hands-on development.
